# Queue Spine System — Spec

Scalable queue architecture for large personal libraries (5k–15k+ tracks). Replaces the current `fields=full` paginated fetch of every track on play.

**Status:** Approved via `/grill-with-docs` (Jul 2026).

## Problem

When a user plays a track from their library, `audio-player-provider` paginates through **all** playable tracks via `/api/user-tracks?fields=full&hasAudio=1` (100 per page). At 5k tracks that is ~50 round-trips and ~50 full Prisma joins (artist, cover, service, **audioFiles** per row). The same pattern applies to playlist context.

## Solution overview

Split the queue into three zones and load data in two tiers:

```
[ Now playing ] → [ Up Next (manual) ] → [ From Library / playlist (spine) ]
```

| Tier                | Data                                               | When loaded                                                       |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Spine**           | `QueueTrack[]` — id, title, artist                 | One request on play                                               |
| **Hydration cache** | `Map<id, FullTrack>` — audioFiles, cover, duration | On demand: current + lookahead (4 tracks)                         |
| **Up Next**         | `QueueTrack[]` — user-injected manual zone         | Persisted via `PlayerState.upNextIds` (ADR-017); restored on load |

## Playback order

On **Next**:

1. Drain **Up Next** front (FIFO among Play-next inserts).
2. Advance **spine pointer** (linear index or seeded shuffled order).
3. **Loop all** wraps spine; **loop one** replays current.

## Navigation

The navigation state machine lives in `app/features/queue/queue-navigation.ts`. It is a pure functional layer — every function takes a `QueueNavigationState` and returns a new value without side effects.

### State type: `QueueNavigationState`

```ts
type QueueNavigationState = {
  upNext: QueueTrack[]; // manual injection zone
  spine: QueueTrack[]; // full play context (library/playlist)
  spineOrder: number[]; // permutation of spine indices (linear or shuffled)
  spinePosition: number; // current position within spineOrder
  loopMode: LoopMode; // 'off' | 'all' | 'one'
};
```

### `resolveNextTrack(state) → QueueTarget | null`

Determines the next track to play after the current one finishes. Rules, applied in order:

1. **Drain Up Next** — if `upNext` is non-empty, return front (`{ zone: 'upNext', index: 0 }`).
2. **Loop one** — if `loopMode === 'one'`, return the current spine position.
3. **Advance spine** — if `spinePosition + 1` is within `spineOrder`, return the next spine position.
4. **Loop all** — if `loopMode === 'all'` and spine is non-empty, wrap to `{ zone: 'spine', index: 0 }`.
5. **End** — return `null` (no more tracks).

Up Next is unaffected by loop mode — it always drains first, then the spine takes over.

### `resolvePreviousTrack(state) → QueueTarget | null`

Determines the previous track. Does **not** look at Up Next — only moves backward through the spine:

1. **Loop one** — if `loopMode === 'one'`, return the current spine position.
2. **Move back** — if `spinePosition - 1 >= 0`, return the previous spine position.
3. **Loop all** — if `loopMode === 'all'` and spine is non-empty, wrap to the last position in `spineOrder`.
4. **End** — return `null`.

### `advanceAfterPlay(state, played) → QueueNavigationState`

Mutates the queue state after a track has finished playing. The behavior depends on which zone the played track came from:

- **Up Next target** — removes the track from `upNext` by its index. The spine is untouched.
- **Spine target** — updates `spinePosition` to `played.index`. The spine array itself is unchanged (tracks are never removed from the spine).

Returns a **new** `QueueNavigationState` — the original is never mutated. The caller replaces its state reference with the returned value.

### `getTrackAtTarget(state, target) → QueueTrack | null`

Resolves a `QueueTarget` to the actual `QueueTrack`:

- **Up Next** — direct array lookup: `state.upNext[target.index]`.
- **Spine** — indirect lookup: maps through `spineOrder[target.index]` to get the raw spine index, then returns `state.spine[spineIndex]`.

Returns `null` if the target index is out of bounds.

### `findSpinePositionForTrackId(state, trackId) → number | null`

Finds the spine position (index into `spineOrder`) for a given track ID. Searches linearly through `spineOrder` and returns the position where `spine[spineIndex].id === trackId`. Returns `null` if the track is not in the spine.

Used when the user taps a specific track in the queue sheet — the provider uses this to sync the spine pointer so next/previous navigation continues from the tapped position.

### Helper predicates

- **`hasNextTrack(state)`** — `resolveNextTrack(state) !== null`
- **`hasPreviousTrack(state)`** — `resolvePreviousTrack(state) !== null`

### View helpers

- **`getSpinePlayOrder(state)`** — the spine tracks from the current position onward (for queue display when nothing is playing).
- **`getUpcomingSpinePlayOrder(state)`** — the spine tracks from position+1 onward (for queue display when a track is playing, excluding "now playing").
- **`buildFlatQueueView(state)`** — concatenates `upNext` + `getSpinePlayOrder(state)` into a single flat array.
- **`flatIndexForSpinePosition(state, spinePosition)`** — maps a spine position to an index in the flat queue view.
- **`getQueueSpineDisplayTracks(state, hasCurrentTrack)`** — returns upcoming spine tracks (position+1) when a track is playing, or the full spine order when nothing is playing.

## Shuffle (seeded Fisher-Yates)

- Shuffle permutes spine **play order** (an index array), never the underlying spine list.
- When shuffle is **enabled**: build a permuted index array over the spine once (or when toggled on).
- When shuffle is **toggled on mid-playback**: reshuffle spine indices **from current position onward**; Up Next zone is untouched.
- **Seeded PRNG** — `mulberry32` over a 32-bit `shuffleSeed` (ADR-017). Seed generated on toggle/reshuffle, persisted in `PlayerState.shuffleSeed`, so a restored queue reproduces the identical order. Seed is positional: a different spine length yields a different (but deterministic) order.
- **Next/Prev** walk the shuffled index list; hydrate full track before play.

## Queue actions

### Labels

| Action             | Player active                                               | Nothing playing                                              |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Play next**      | Insert at **front** of Up Next (FIFO among Play-next items) | Cue track as **current (paused)**; open player; no auto-play |
| **Add to up next** | Append to **end** of Up Next                                | Queue in Up Next; open player; no auto-play                  |
| **Add to queue**   | Append to **true end** (after entire spine)                 | Queue at true end; open player; no auto-play                 |

### Bulk playlist UI

Expose all three bulk actions. Default / primary for “add whole playlist” is **Add to up next**.

## API

### `GET /api/queue-spine`

Single-response spine fetch (no pagination).

Query params:

- `context=library` | `playlist`
- `playlistId` (required when context=playlist)
- `hasAudio=1` (library only — playable tracks)

Response:

```json
{
  "tracks": [{ "id": "...", "title": "...", "artist": { "id": "...", "name": "..." } }],
  "total": 14832
}
```

Implementation: one Prisma query with minimal `select` (same projection as `fields=minimal` today). Consider response compression (gzip is automatic).

### `GET /api/tracks/playback`

Batch hydration for playback.

Query params:

- `ids` — comma-separated track IDs (max ~20)

Response:

```json
{
  "tracks": [/* FullTrack shape with audioFiles, coverImage, duration */]
}
```

## Client modules

| Module                                   | Responsibility                                             |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `app/features/queue/queue-spine.ts`      | Spine fetch, types                                         |
| `app/features/queue/queue-hydration.ts`  | Batch fetch + cache                                        |
| `app/features/queue/queue-shuffle.ts`    | Seeded Fisher-Yates (`mulberry32`), reshuffle-from-current |
| `app/features/queue/queue-navigation.ts` | Next/prev resolution across Up Next + spine                |
| `audio-player-provider.tsx`              | Orchestration (spine fetch, hydration, navigation)         |

## Queue sheet UI

Three sections in the bottom sheet:

1. **Now playing** (highlighted)
2. **Up Next** — manual zone; virtual list if large
3. **From Library** / **From Playlist** — spine; existing virtual scroll

## Offline

Unchanged fallback: if spine fetch returns empty, use `offline-storage` pinned / playlist lists. Hydration uses cached OPFS paths when available.

## Non-goals (v1)

- Drag-and-drop reorder of spine
- Server-side shuffle (client seeded Fisher-Yates is sufficient)

> Note: "queue persistence across sessions" was originally a v1 non-goal; it shipped later via ADR-017 (`PlayerState`).

## Edge Cases

This section documents the known edge cases in the queue navigation and mutation operations, derived from the implementation in `app/features/queue/queue-navigation.ts` and `app/components/audio-player-provider.tsx`.

### Null returns from `resolveNextTrack`

`resolveNextTrack` returns `null` when no track can be resolved in the forward direction. The callers must handle `null` gracefully (e.g., by disabling the "Next" button or letting playback stop).

| Condition                                  | Up Next | Spine state                             | Loop mode | Result |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------- | --------------------------------------- | --------- | ------ |
| Empty queue                                | Empty   | `spineOrder.length === 0`               | Any       | `null` |
| End of spine with loop off                 | Empty   | `spinePosition` is last in `spineOrder` | `off`     | `null` |
| End of spine with loop-all but empty spine | Empty   | `spineOrder.length === 0`               | `all`     | `null` |

**Note:** `loopMode === 'one'` returns the current spine position — but only _after_ Up Next is drained. Up Next always drains first (rule 1), so with a non-empty Up Next, `resolveNextTrack` returns the Up Next front regardless of loop mode. Loop-one applies to the spine only.

**Caller contract:** The `audio-player-provider` calls `resolveNextTrack` in `playNext`, the `removeCurrentFromQueue` fallback, and the queue-sheet-driven `advanceToTarget` path. Every caller checks for `null` before proceeding — `playNext` returns early, `advanceToTarget` is guarded by `hasNextTrack`.

### Null returns from `resolvePreviousTrack`

`resolvePreviousTrack` returns `null` when no track can be resolved in the backward direction.

| Condition                                    | Spine state                                      | Loop mode | Result |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------- | ------ |
| Empty queue                                  | `spineOrder.length === 0`                        | Any       | `null` |
| Start of spine with loop off                 | `spinePosition === 0`                            | `off`     | `null` |
| Start of spine with loop-all but empty spine | `spinePosition === 0`, `spineOrder.length === 0` | `all`     | `null` |

**Note:** Unlike `resolveNextTrack`, `resolvePreviousTrack` does NOT consider the Up Next zone. Previous navigation only walks backward through the spine play order. If the user wants to go back to a track that just played from Up Next, they cannot — Up Next items are drained (removed) on play via `advanceAfterPlay`.

**Note:** `loopMode === 'one'` always returns the current spine position and never produces `null` from `resolvePreviousTrack`.

### Index-based duplicate removal

The spine can contain the same track ID at multiple positions. `addTrackToPlaylist(position='end')` does not deduplicate — it appends to the `spine` array and `spineOrder` without checking for existing entries. This means the same track can appear multiple times in the queue.

Key behaviors when duplicates exist:

| Operation                                    | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `removeTrackFromPlaylist(spine, orderIndex)` | Removes the track at the given `spineOrder` index only. If the same track ID appears at multiple spine indices, only the targeted occurrence is removed. The other occurrences remain and their `spineOrder` indices are adjusted (decremented if they were positioned after the removal). |
| `findSpinePositionForTrackId(trackId)`       | Returns the **first** position in `spineOrder` whose spine index maps to the given track ID. Uses `Array.findIndex`. If the same track ID appears multiple times, only the earliest occurrence is found.                                                                                   |
| `removeCurrentFromQueue()`                   | Uses `findSpinePositionForTrackId` to locate the current track. If duplicates exist, it removes only the first occurrence.                                                                                                                                                                 |

**Implication:** When a track appears multiple times in the spine and the user removes "the current track," only the first occurrence is removed. The duplicate further ahead in the queue remains. Callers iterating removal until no occurrences remain must loop — a single `removeCurrentFromQueue` call is not sufficient.

### Spine pointer validity after mutation

The `spinePosition` is an index into `spineOrder` (not the raw `spine` array). Mutation operations update `spine`, `spineOrder`, and `spinePosition` atomically via React state setters, but the validity guarantees differ by operation.

#### `addTrackToPlaylist(position='end')`

Appends a track to the end of both `spine` and `spineOrder`. `spinePosition` is **not adjusted**. The pointer remains valid — it still references the same position in `spineOrder`, which maps to the same raw spine index (provided no concurrent reordering has shifted indices). Since the append only adds at the end, existing indices are unchanged.

#### `addTrackToPlaylist(position='next' | 'upNext')`

Only modifies `upNext`. Neither `spine`, `spineOrder`, nor `spinePosition` are touched. Pointer remains fully valid.

#### `removeTrackFromPlaylist(zone='spine')`

Three cases based on the removed track's position relative to `spinePosition`:

| Relationship                   | Effect on `spinePosition`                                                                                                                         | Pointer validity                                                                         |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `orderIndex < spinePosition`   | Decremented by 1 to compensate for the shift                                                                                                      | Still correct — points to the same logical track after the gap closes                    |
| `orderIndex === spinePosition` | Current track is being removed. Advances to the next track via `advanceAfterPlay` and plays it (or clears `currentTrack` if no next track exists) | N/A — the current track is gone; playback moves forward                                  |
| `orderIndex > spinePosition`   | Unchanged                                                                                                                                         | Still correct — the removed track was ahead in the queue, current position is unaffected |

After a spine removal, `spineOrder` is filtered and remaining indices are re-mapped: any spine index greater than the removed index is decremented by 1. This keeps the `spineOrder → spine` mapping valid.

#### `removeTrackFromPlaylist(zone='upNext')`

Only modifies `upNext` and optionally `upNextPlayNextCount`. Does NOT touch `spine`, `spineOrder`, or `spinePosition`. Pointer remains fully valid.

#### `toggleShuffle` (on)

Calls `reshuffleFromCurrent(spineOrder, spinePosition)`. The prefix (indices 0 to `spinePosition`, i.e. already played plus the current track) is preserved; the suffix (from `spinePosition + 1` onward, the upcoming tracks) is Fisher-Yates shuffled. `spinePosition` is **not changed** — it still points to the same track at the same position in the partially-reshuffled `spineOrder`. The current track's position is preserved; only upcoming tracks are reordered.

#### `toggleShuffle` (off)

Replaces `spineOrder` with an identity-order array `[0, 1, 2, ...]` and adjusts `spinePosition` to match the raw spine index of the current track. This correctly re-maps the pointer from shuffled-order-space to identity-order-space.

#### Full queue reset (`playTrack`, `playLibrary`, `playUserPlaylist`, `playPlaylist`)

These operations set entirely new `spine`, `spineOrder`, and `spinePosition` values. The old state is discarded. No pointer validity concern — this is a fresh queue, not a mutation of an existing one.

#### Edge case: `spineOrder` and `spine` length mismatch

`spineOrder` is always a permutation of indices into `spine`. After the initial spine load and after every mutation, the two arrays are kept consistent:

- `spineOrder[i]` is always a valid index into `spine` (0 ≤ value < spine.length)
- `spineOrder.length === spine.length` always holds

There is no code path that produces a length mismatch. A `spineOrder` index pointing past the end of `spine` would be a bug, not an expected edge case.
