# ADR-002: Eliminating Cross-Boundary Imports Between App and Server Layers

## Status

Accepted (Note: the audio worker was removed in ADR-004, then reintroduced as `app/features/audio-archive/` by ADR-011 on 2026-07-07)

## Context

The Music Library application has a hybrid architecture with two distinct layers:

- **React Router Layer** (`app/`): Handles web requests, UI, and user interactions
- **Express Server Layer** (`server/`): Handles background workers and background processing

During development, we encountered cross-boundary import issues where the admin UI was importing functions directly from server workers, creating architectural coupling and build complexity.

**Note**: This ADR documents the architectural pattern used for the audio worker system. The original `server/workers/` layout was removed (ADR-004), then the worker was reintroduced as the self-contained `app/features/audio-archive/` feature module (ADR-011, 2026-07-07). The database-as-communication-layer principles described here remain valid.

### Problems with Cross-Boundary Imports

#### 1. Admin UI Importing from Server Workers

```typescript
// Example from removed audio-queue.tsx
// app/routes/admin+/audio-queue.tsx (removed)
import { getQueueStats, getTracksForAdmin, enqueueTrack } from "#server/workers/audio-queue";
import { pauseWorker, resumeWorker, getWorkerStatus } from "#server/workers/audio-worker-control";
```

#### 2. Server Workers Importing from App Utils

```typescript
// Example from removed audio-queue.ts
// server/workers/audio-queue.ts (removed)
import { prisma } from "#app/utils/db.server";
import { uploadAudioFile } from "#app/utils/storage.server";
```

#### 3. Build System Complexity

- React Router build (`build:remix`) needed to access server code
- Express build (`build:server`) needed to access app code
- Path alias resolution across different build systems
- Module resolution errors in production

#### 4. Architectural Violations

- Tight coupling between layers
- Violation of separation of concerns
- Difficult to scale or split services later
- Mixed responsibilities in single functions

### Requirements

- Clean architectural separation between app and server layers
- Zero cross-boundary imports
- Maintainable and scalable architecture
- Fast build times
- Clear communication patterns between layers

## Decision

Implement **Option 4: Database State Communication** - Use the database as the communication layer between app and server components.

### Architecture Pattern

#### Database as Communication Layer

```
Admin UI                    Database                    Worker
   ↓                           ↓                           ↓
Write state          ←→   Shared tables   ←→      Read/process state
```

#### Key Principles

1. **Database is Single Source of Truth**: All state changes go through database
2. **Eventually Consistent**: Components communicate through database state
3. **No Direct Function Calls**: No imports between app and server layers
4. **Event-Driven**: Changes propagate through database state changes

### Implementation Strategy

#### 1. Admin UI Operations

Replace function calls with direct database operations:

**Before:**

```typescript
const result = await pauseWorker();
```

**After:**

```typescript
await prisma.workerState.update({
  where: { id: "singleton" },
  data: { status: "paused", lastStateChange: new Date() },
});
return data({ success: true, message: "Worker pause requested (will take effect in ~5 min)" });
```

#### 2. Worker State Reading

Workers check database state on each loop:

```typescript
// server/workers/audio-worker.ts
const workerState = await prisma.workerState.findUnique({
  where: { id: "singleton" },
});

if (workerState.status === "running") {
  await processQueue();
} else {
  console.log(`Worker status is ${workerState.status}, skipping queue processing`);
}
```

#### 3. Efficient Data Queries

Use optimized database queries instead of function wrappers:

**Before:**

```typescript
const [stats, tracks, workerStatus] = await Promise.all([
  getQueueStats(),           // 5 separate count queries
  getTracksForAdmin({ ... }), // Function wrapper
  getWorkerStatus(),          // Function wrapper
])
```

**After:**

```typescript
// Example from removed audio queue system
const [statsGrouped, tracks, workerState] = await Promise.all([
  prisma.trackAudioFile.groupBy({ by: ['status'], _count: { _all: true } }), // 1 grouped query (removed)
  prisma.trackAudioFile.findMany({ ... }), // Direct query (removed)
  prisma.workerState.findUnique({ where: { id: 'singleton' } }), // Direct query (removed)
])
```

## Consequences

### Positive

- ✅ **Zero Cross-Boundary Imports**: Complete architectural separation
- ✅ **Faster Page Loads**: 4 queries instead of 8 (groupBy vs separate counts)
- ✅ **Instant UI Feedback**: Actions return immediately
- ✅ **Scalable Architecture**: Can move worker to separate service
- ✅ **Resilient Components**: App and server can fail independently
- ✅ **Auditable Operations**: All changes logged in database
- ✅ **Simpler Builds**: No complex path resolution between layers
- ✅ **Better Performance**: More efficient SQL queries

### Negative

- ⚠️ **Eventually Consistent**: Worker changes take ~5 minutes to propagate
- ⚠️ **No Graceful Shutdown**: Worker doesn't wait for current downloads to finish
- ⚠️ **Some Query Duplication**: Similar Prisma queries in different places
- ⚠️ **Inline Helper Functions**: Small utility functions need to be inline

### Neutral

- 🔄 **Different Communication Pattern**: Event-driven vs direct function calls
- 🔄 **Database Schema Coupling**: Components coupled through database schema
- 🔄 **State Management**: Database becomes the state management layer

## Implementation Details

### File Structure Changes

```
// Example structure from removed audio worker system
app/routes/admin+/audio-queue.tsx (removed)
├── Direct Prisma queries (no server imports)
├── Inline helper functions
└── Database state updates

server/workers/ (removed)
├── audio-worker.ts (reads database state)
├── audio-queue.ts (self-contained)
└── audio-worker-control.ts (self-contained)

server/utils/
├── db.ts (simple Prisma client)
└── storage.ts (minimal storage functions)
```

### Key Patterns

#### Admin UI Loader Pattern

```typescript
// Example from removed audio queue system
export async function loader({ request }) {
  // Direct Prisma queries - no cross-boundary imports
  const [statsGrouped, tracks, workerState] = await Promise.all([
    prisma.trackAudioFile.groupBy({ by: ["status"], _count: { _all: true } }), // Removed
    prisma.trackAudioFile.findMany({ include: { track: true } }), // Removed
    prisma.workerState.findUnique({ where: { id: "singleton" } }), // Removed
  ]);

  return data({ statsGrouped, tracks, workerState });
}
```

#### Admin UI Action Pattern

```typescript
export async function action({ request }) {
  const intent = formData.get("intent");

  switch (intent) {
    case "pause-worker":
      // Direct database write
      await prisma.workerState.update({
        where: { id: "singleton" },
        data: { status: "paused", lastStateChange: new Date() },
      });
      return data({ success: true, message: "Worker pause requested" });
  }
}
```

#### Worker State Check Pattern

```typescript
// Example from removed audio worker system
async function workerLoop() {
  // Read state from database
  const workerState = await prisma.workerState.findUnique({
    where: { id: "singleton" },
  });

  // Respect database state
  if (workerState.status === "paused") {
    console.log("Worker paused by admin");
    return;
  }

  // Process queue
  await processQueue();
}
```

### Helper Functions

Small utility functions are kept inline to avoid cross-boundary imports:

```typescript
// Inline helper functions
function calculateNextLongBreak(): Date {
  const hours = 6 + Math.random() * 2; // Random 6-8 hours
  return new Date(Date.now() + hours * 60 * 60 * 1000);
}

function formatWorkerStatus(workerState: any) {
  // Format worker state for UI display
  // ...
}
```

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Shared Utils Folder

- **Pros**: DRY principle, shared types, immediate execution
- **Cons**: Build coupling, configuration complexity, shared code maintenance
- **Decision**: Rejected - adds build complexity and coupling

### Alternative 2: API Endpoints

- **Pros**: True separation, RESTful, scalable
- **Cons**: HTTP overhead, more code, complexity
- **Decision**: Rejected - overkill for current needs

### Alternative 3: Duplicate Functions

- **Pros**: No cross-boundary imports, simple
- **Cons**: Code duplication, maintenance burden, drift risk
- **Decision**: Rejected - violates DRY principle

### Alternative 4: Event-Driven Architecture

- **Pros**: Decoupled, scalable, real-time
- **Cons**: Infrastructure complexity, debugging difficulty
- **Decision**: Rejected - too complex for current needs

### Alternative 5: Hybrid Approach

- **Pros**: Best of both worlds
- **Cons**: Still has some cross-boundary imports
- **Decision**: Rejected - doesn't achieve complete separation

## Migration Strategy
